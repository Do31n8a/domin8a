                <p>The games I am currently playing are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>World of Tanks</li>
                    <li>Beat Saber</li>
                    <li>CSGO</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>World of Tanks</h2>
                <p>World of Tanks is a game where you get put into a 15v15 battle and you are all in tanks. You need to get more XP and money to research new tanks. There are 10 tiers of tanks, 1 being the worst and 10 being the best. I am currently at Tier 8 and have been playing for nearly 5 years.</p>
                
                <h2>Beat Saber</h2>
                <p>Beat Saber is a VR game where you slash boxes with lightsabers. Your left hand lightsaber is red and your right hand lightsaber is blue. The boxes are either blue or red too and you have to hit them with the same colour saber. They also have arrows on them and you need to hit them with that direction. The game is really fun and has recently recieved a new update and music pack.</p>
                
                <h2>CSGO</h2>
                <p>In cs:go, you are on one of two teams. These teams are terrorists, or counter-terrorists. As terrorists, you have to either plant a bomb and get it to explode, or just kill all of the CTs. As a CT, you have to kill all the terrorists and/or defuse the bomb. I have been playing this for 5 and a half years and still enjoy it.</p>
