                <h2>GTS</h2>
                <p>GTS (Gran Turismo Sport) is a VR racing game that focuses on you, the player, being one of the best racers in the world. I want it because I enjoy racing games, and even more if they are in VR</p>
                
                <h2>Job Simulator</h2>
                <p>Job simulator is another VR game and what you do is you do Jobs (as you could of probably guessed). But it is fun because you are the only human in a fully robotic world. The jobs range from being a mechanic to being a chef.</p>
                
                <h2>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h2>
                <p>This is a VR Horror game where you have to explore houses filled with ghosts and other scary, paranormal things. It gives you an adrenalin rush and looks really fun overall.</p>
                
                <h2>Beat Saber Music Pack 2</h2>
                <p>Beat Saber Recently Updated and got a new music pack. The music pack has all of Imagine Dragons songs and I really want it. There are 10 songs in total and looks really fun.</p>
